Well so you decided to try it out it's not going to be great but it's kinda good here is what you have to do:

config.jar: minor distraction (use scroll on progress bars for animation)

ScreenBrr.bat: actual stuff

kill.bat: stops java

kill_all.bat: stops java and command prompt(batch files too)

swat.bat: stops java repeatedly

The actual stuff has two phases

1.unresponsiveness

2.torture

unresponsiveness can be exited by scrolling down or up depending upon mouse setting(try both to see which works)

after unresponsiveness, torture starts. here are the stuff that it does:

1.message typing

2.capslock toggle

3.mouse random movement

4.mouse jitter

5.random mouse scrolling

6.beeping

7.screen rotation

8.spiders(can be killed by scrolling on them)

9.explorer process killing

The only way to exit it to use any of the java killers, task manager or a restart

Good luck!!
